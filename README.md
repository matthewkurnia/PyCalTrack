# PyCalTrack: An Enhanced Software Solution for High-Throughput Analysis of Calcium Transients and Contractility in Cardiomyocytes

PyCalTrack is a a Python redesign of [CalTrack](https://github.com/ToepferLab/CalTrack)'s functionality and architecture which aims to be fully free and open-source. PyCalTrack has two pathways for obtaining calcium traces. It can extract them from videos, or it can import them directly from a prior analysis. Extracting traces from videos involves obtaining masks for the cells in the videos. This masking process is different for single-cell and multi-cell videos. After obtaining traces, they are then analysed, generating a set of calcium measurements of biological relevance. Finally, the results of trace extraction and analysis is saved onto disk in the form of Excel files. Each part of this pipeline will be discussed in-depth in this chapter.

## Pre-requisites

In order to run PyCalTrack on your system, please make sure that you have [Conda](https://anaconda.org/) installed on your system. We recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html), as it is a lighter installation, but any distribution of Anaconda should work just as well. We also recommend installing the [libmamba](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community) environment solver in order to save time during the setup of the virtual environment.

## Installation

### Get a copy of the code

You can get the code on your machine by downloading the code in .zip format from github directly, or you can clone this repository using the following commands:

```bash
git clone REPOSITORY_LINK
cd PyCalTrack
```

### Create and activate the virtual environment

If you are on a unix-based operating system (any Linux distribution, MacOS), you can install the required packages on a conda virtual environment by typing in the following command:

```bash
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```

If you are on Windows, you can do the same thing by typing in the following command:

```bash
conda env create --file=environment_windows.yml
```

Keep in mind that this process may take a few minutes. Once the installation is done, you can activate the python virtual environment by typing in the following command:

```bash
conda activate PyCalTrack
```

## Running PyCalTrack

In order to run PyCalTrack, type in the following command:

```bash
python cal_track.py
```

This runs PyCalTrack on sample videos, specifically the `samples/dataset1_RGECO_SingleCell` dataset.

## Configuring PyCalTrack

```python
from enum import Enum

Usage = Enum("Usage", ["SINGLE_CELL", "MULTI_CELL"])

### WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE ABOVE THIS LINE! ###

usage = Usage.SINGLE_CELL
acquisition_frequency = 50
pacing_frequency = 1
apply_photo_bleach_correction = False
beginning_frames_removed = 1
max_pacing_deviation = 0.1
good_snr = False
quiet = True
save_tau_fittings = False

extract_traces = True

videos_directory = "samples/dataset1_RGECO_SingleCell"

trace_path = "samples/dataset1_RGECO_SingleCell/pycaltrack_analysis/calcium_traces.xlsx"
```

In order to modify the behaviour of PyCalTrack, you can edit the `cal_track_config.py` file. Each configurable parameter's data type and usage can be seen in the following table.

| Name                          | Data Type                     | Usage                                                                                                       |
